During my fifteen hour flight to the United States in 2017, all I could think about was how excited I felt to reunite with my husband there and build a happy family. Little did I know that being an immigrant in the United States would be filled with so many obstacles. I found myself in a different culture where I look different, speak differently, and knew no one besides my spouse. I felt like a stranger and I struggled to adapt. Moreover, I realized that my dental degree was not transferable and I was not able to practice dentistry. Life indeed became a big challenge for me; nonetheless, this struggle had become a source of inspiration throughout the following years of my life. I completed Part One NBDE only a few weeks prior to giving birth to my beloved child at the end of 2017. I studied for Part Two with my one year old in my lap. Having always been very close to my supportive parents and five siblings, I was proud to have accomplished this on my own without my family near me.  I felt empowered and fueled to achieve more.



In retrospect, despite growing up in Sudan, a developing country with high illiteracy rates, I consider myself very privileged because I had access to higher education.. It was my dream to become a dentist and my parents encouraged me along the way. After graduating high school with straight A’s, I was accepted in Sudan’s top university, The University of Khartoum, where I graduated among the top 5% of my class. During my time in college, pursuing a career in Oral medicine specialty was not yet on my radar; however during a rotation  in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery as part of a post-grad residency,, I was assigned a patient that I would never forget. She was a five year old girl who had been continuously admitted to hospitals and received injections more than she played with toys. Sadly, she had been to many doctors who were not knowledgeable enough to properly manage her case given her condition. In addition, her family struggled with poverty and was unable to afford treatment. She presented with oral manifestations of leukemia, I wanted to help this child or at least mitigate her suffering, yet my knowledge was limited. The few days I spent with that girl were eye opening to me and that was the moment I discovered what I wanted— I wanted to be able to diagnose and learn about the proper management of all different kinds of non-dental oral diseases, especially systemic diseases with oral manifestations. Oral pathology, on the contrary, was my passion since my third lecture with our talented Professor, Dr. Nazik who made it very comprehensible and interesting. I also spent six months working in her laboratory assisting with handling specimens and research. This gave rise to my interest in oral oncology as well, since we received a new cancer case almost everyday. Given my interest in the clinical aspect of oral pathology rather than histopathology, I know that Oral Medicine best fits my career path.


There are two main goals that I hope to achieve upon successfully completing training in Oral Medicine; to become one of the few Sudanese specialists in Oral Medicine in the world, and to contribute to the profession through research and teaching. Sudan may be known for the massacre of innocent people in Darfur, the recent famous uprising, and the suppression of human freedom; I want it to be known for well-educated and experienced clinicians and  researchers. I have always believed in Abraham Maslow’s famous saying: “If you plan on becoming anything less than you are capable of being, you will probably be unhappy all the days of your life.”As a candidate for your program, I will strive to improve my skills to ensure that the well being of my patients remains the utmost priority. I will always remain reliable and respectful for both my colleagues and patients. Completing an Oral Medicine program at an esteemed institution is a dream that I hope will soon become a reality. I know that pursuing a career in Oral medicine requires perseverance and commitment; characteristics I humbly possess.
